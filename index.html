      <h3>Parts of speech</h3>
      <p>
        There are eight parts of speech in the English language: noun, pronoun,
        verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The part of speech indicates how the word functions in meaning as well
        as grammatically within the sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        An individual word can function as more than one part of speech when
        used in different circumstances.
      </p>

      <p id="noun-info">
        <h3>Noun</h3>
        A noun is a word for a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are often
        used with an article (the, a, an), but not always. Proper nouns always
        start with a capital letter; common nouns do not. Nouns can be singular
        or plural, concrete or abstract. Nouns show possession by adding 's.
        Nouns can function in different roles within a sentence; for example, a
        noun can be a subject, direct object, indirect object, subject
        complement, or object of a preposition.
      </p>
      <p id="pronoun-info">
        <h3>Pronoun</h3>
        A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun. A pronoun is usually
        substituted for a specific noun, which is called its antecedent. In the
        sentence above, the antecedent for the pronoun she is the girl. Pronouns
        are further defined by type: personal pronouns refer to specific persons
        or things; possessive pronouns indicate ownership; reflexive pronouns
        are used to emphasize another noun or pronoun; relative pronouns
        introduce a subordinate clause; and demonstrative pronouns identify,
        point to, or refer to nouns.
      </p>
      <h3>Verb</h3>
      <p id="verb-info">
        The verb in a sentence expresses action or being. There is a main verb
        and sometimes one or more helping verbs. ("She can sing." Sing is the
        main verb; can is the helping verb.) A verb must agree with its subject
        in number (both are singular or both are plural). Verbs also take
        different forms to express tense.
      </p>
      <h3>Preposition</h3>
      <p id="preposition-info">
        A preposition is a word placed before a noun or pronoun to form a phrase
        modifying another word in the sentence. Therefore a preposition is
        always part of a prepositional phrase. The prepositional phrase almost
        always functions as an adjective or as an adverb. The following list
        includes the most common prepositions:
      </p>
      <h3>Adjective</h3>
      <p id="adjective-info">
        An adjective is a word used to modify or describe a noun or a pronoun.
        It usually answers the question of which one, what kind, or how many.
        (Articles [a, an, the] are usually classified as adjectives.)
      </p>
      <h3>Adverb</h3>
      <p id="adverb-info">
        An adverb describes or modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb,
        but never a noun. It usually answers the questions of when, where, how,
        why, under what conditions, or to what degree. Adverbs often end in -ly.
      </p>
      <p id="conjunction-info">
        <h3>Conjunction</h3>
        A conjunction joins words, phrases, or clauses, and indicates the
        relationship between the elements joined. Coordinating conjunctions
        connect grammatically equal elements: and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet.
        Subordinating conjunctions connect clauses that are not equal: because,
        although, while, since, etc. There are other types of conjunctions as
        well.
      </p>
      <h3>Interjection</h3>
      <p id="interjection-info">
        An interjection is a word used to express emotion. It is often followed
        by an exclamation point.
